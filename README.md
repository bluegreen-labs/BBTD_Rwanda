# Banana bunchy top disease in Rwanda: identifying disease presence and areas at risk

## Abstract

Banana bunchy top disease (BBTD) is a viral banana disease which causes significant yield losses. Here we develop a BBTD probability map for Rwanda to help inform the 'Rwanda Agriculture and Animal Resources Development Board' on areas at risk for BBTD introduction and establishment, and priority areas for monitoring, control, and extension efforts. The BBTD probability model relies on BBTD field surveys from Rwanda, eastern DR Congo, Burundi, and Uganda; and on environmental, land-use/land-cover, and socioeconomic variables.
